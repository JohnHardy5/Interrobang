4.0 Software Development Plan 
4.1 Plan Introduction 
Interrobang is a First Person 3D Puzzle Video Game built around a looping map design.
We believe this project will be an appropriate project for 401, as it will force us to see through design decisions, and realize these ideas through code. It was also allow us to learn new software, as well as the C++ programming language. The project is also scalable, as the basic idea for the game is easily doable within a single, but can grow far beyond this, depending on how much our team is able to get done. Likewise, this will allow us to learn skills necessary for working in a group, and how to properly divide work so that it will get done in the most efficient manner. Development will involve learning basics of Unity and Maya, brainstorming ideas for the game, learning best practices for implementing these ideas, modeling basic objects for the game in Maya, and developing the mechanics of the game through various C++ scripts. The culmination of this process will result in a fully functioning game with most if not all of the brainstormed ideas working as intended.


Sub-task Completion Dates
	Basic movement is working in Unity: Basic character movement is working
	Week 5
	Basic Level is finished in Unity: The general format of what the main level within the game is finished
	Week 5
	Brainstorming for assets: Assets the project needs to get developed in Maya are discussed so that they can eventually make their way into the game. 
	Week 6
	Level Testing: Level is tested against the player movement. Changes are made until both movement and level complement each other
	Week 6
	Asset Creation: Assets have been created and added to the game. More assets are given to the asset creator to continue creating.
	Week 7
	Visual Design: Visuals of the game are discussed, art director is tasked with converting the basic level into a level that incorporates this visual design concept.
	Week 7
	MVP Completed: Minimal Viable Product finished, which includes character moving flawlessly in the main level, with the character able to loop through the level five times, and complete five different puzzles each time, to demonstrate the core tenants necessary for the game.

4.2.2 Software Resources
The two main resources that will be used in this project are Unity and Maya. Unity will handle the bulk of the core game design processes, as well as house the finished video game application. Maya will be used to design and model assets for the game to be imported into Unity. Music composition software Finale and music mixing software Fl Studios will be used as well in order to develop sound clips and music for the game. Visual Studios will be used to write and compile code written in C++.

4.3 Project Organization 
* Merci Magallanes: Art Director, Asset Creation/3D modeler, UI Artist, Animator
   * Merci is in charge of creating the overall art direction of the project to make sure the visual style of the game is consistent and complements the rest of the game. Along with this, she is tasked with using Maya to make any assets that are not easily available within Unity. Simple animations may also be necessary, and thus Merci will be the one to handle the situations in which animation is appropriate. Lastly, she will be given the duty of designing a user interface that is both effective and complements the games visuals.


* Joey Martinez: Project Manager, Game Designer, Level Designer, Additional Programming, Music Producer/Audio Mixing and Mastering Engineer
   * Joey will handle manage the overall project in terms of organizing each member in the project and their roles within the group. He will make sure that each person knows what needs to get done during each week. Likewise, the overall concept of the game will be designed by Joey and it will be Joey’s job to make sure everyone on the group knows of this direction. Lastly, Joey will handle making sure music and audio clips make it into the game, and that there is an overall acceptable quality to all of the audio files.


* John Hardy: Lead Programmer, UI Developer, Technical Director, Quality Assurance Tester, Version Control Manager 
   * John is tasked with developing most of the code used to handle the designs expected to be in the game. He will make sure that all the design decisions developed by Joey will be interpreted into the game correctly through code, so that it best reflects the original intent of the design. Likewise, he is tasked with making sure that all code is tested and working correctly. He will also be tasked with making sure the UI will adhere to the design given by Merci. Lastly, he is in charge of making sure version control happens correctly, and in a clear and efficient manner.


* Christian Alva: Music Composer
   * Christian will handle creating a score that both engages the player and complements the tone and feel of the game.
The Project manager will handle making sure everyone knows the work that needs to get done each week, and to remind each member of the planned schedule. Communication of this will happen at biweekly meetings in the Keck Lab. Communication outside of meetings will happen through Slack, and in urgent cases, text message. All members, except for the music composer, will be pushing code to Github. Each member will be expected to communicate effectively through commit messages, during meetings, and through slack messages the changes they have made so that everyone knows the current state of the project. Overall, version control will be overviewed by the Version Control Manager to make sure conflicts are handled, everything is up to date, and that all commits contain working, efficient, and clean code.
